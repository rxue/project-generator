# Java Project Generator by Means of *Maven Archetype*
All the archetypes are generated on base of the [Guide to Creating Archetypes](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-creating-archetypes.html) with Artefact Group ID - `org.apache.maven.archetypes`

## How to Use
The logically simplest way to use any of the archetype is to go to that directory and run `git install` according to the [Guide to Creating Archetypes](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-creating-archetypes.html), then generate the project by using the command in that directory's README
